Please note that the dataset is quite large and therefore sub-setting was necessary for both the "edx" and the "final_holdout_test" data frames before fitting the linear regression model.

Even after sub-setting, the average code execution time is about 30 minutes, therefore you may need to be patient as the code runs.
